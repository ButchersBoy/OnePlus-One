<h1>DroidKit for the OnePlus One</h1>
This toolkit is a work in progress and is not released yet due to a few errors that will be fixed before release. This uses ButchersBoy's Material Design ( https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit ) and Dragablz ( https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz ) which are also open source. And in theory if you want a feature feel free to submit an issue or post in the xda thread ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one/orig-development/oneplus-one-windows-toolkitgui-t3056455 )
